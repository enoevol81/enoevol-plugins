# Finding true north: execution entry points

An entry point is a file the outside world invokes directly -- an OS, a
runtime, a platform, a CI system, or a human following the README. The
keep-set is everything transitively reachable from these. Getting this list
right matters more than anything downstream, so collect evidence for each
entry point rather than assuming.

Ask three questions of every project:

1. **How is it started?** (start commands, service definitions, README run
   instructions)
2. **What does the platform load?** (manifest-declared files the host
   discovers on its own)
3. **What do CI and deploy run?** (workflows exercise files nothing else
   references)

## Where to look, by ecosystem

### Node / JavaScript

- `package.json`: `main`, `bin`, `exports`, `module`, and every command in
  `scripts` (parse the actual commands -- `"start": "node server.js"` makes
  `server.js` an entry point; test runners make the test glob an entry point).
- `Dockerfile` `CMD`/`ENTRYPOINT`, `Procfile`, `docker-compose.yml` commands.
- CI workflows (`.github/workflows/*.yml`): every script or file they invoke.
- Framework conventions: `next.config.*` implies `pages/`/`app/` are
  platform-loaded; same idea for Nuxt, Remix, Astro, SvelteKit.

### Python

- `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]` / `setup.py` `entry_points`.
- `__main__.py`, `manage.py`, `wsgi.py`/`asgi.py`.
- The README: stdlib-server projects are often started with a bare
  `python app/server.py` documented nowhere else.
- Scheduled/service invocations: systemd units, Task Scheduler exports,
  cron lines in docs.

### Static / no-build web (in-browser Babel, vendored libs)

- The HTML files a server serves or a browser opens: every `<script src>`,
  `<link href>`, `<img src>` is an edge.
- JS that fetches more code or assets at runtime: `fetch("...jsx")`,
  dynamic `import()`, worker constructors. Path literals in served JS are
  edges too.
- The server's static-file root: anything under a directory the server
  serves wholesale is reachable by URL -- treat the served root as
  directory-level KEEP unless individual files are provably never requested.

### Blender add-ons

- `__init__.py` with `bl_info` is the platform entry point; Blender imports
  it and calls `register()`. Everything imported from there is reachable.
- Icon/asset loads via `bpy.utils.previews` and datafile paths are edges.
- `blender_manifest.toml` (4.2+ extensions) declares wheels and files.

### Claude Code plugins / skills

- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` and `marketplace.json` `source` paths.
- Every `SKILL.md` (frontmatter makes it platform-loaded), plus every file
  it links: `references/`, `scripts/`, `assets/`, `agents/`.
- `hooks/hooks.json` commands, `.mcp.json` server entries, `commands/*.md`.
- A reference file linked from nowhere is a candidate; a script mentioned in
  SKILL.md is keep-set even if no code imports it.

This section is for a project that **is** a Claude plugin -- trace it like any
other. Do not confuse it with agent artifacts (`CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/`, plugin
droppings) left inside an *unrelated* app; those are not entry points and are
handled by the Phase 2.5 gate -- see
[agent-artifacts.md](agent-artifacts.md).

### Monorepos

Run the whole process per package/app. A package nothing depends on and no
deploy target ships is itself a candidate -- check the workspace graph
(`pnpm why`, workspace globs, internal `dependencies`) before concluding
that.

## Tracing rules

- **Static edges**: `import`/`require`/`from ... import`, HTML tag
  references, config keys naming files. Follow them transitively.
- **String-literal paths**: grep the keep-set for quoted paths
  (`open(`, `fetch(`, `readFile(`, `src=`, `href=`). A path built at runtime
  from variables cannot be traced -- see next rule.
- **Dynamic loading widens, never narrows**: glob imports, route
  auto-discovery, plugin registries, template-engine lookups, and
  `import(someVar)` mean the target *directory* joins the keep-set whole.
  Note in the report that precision was lost and why.
- **Config, data, and secrets are implicitly reachable**: dotenv files,
  migration folders, seed data the code opens by convention. When code reads
  a directory rather than a file, keep the directory.
- **Tests are entry points too** (via the test command), which is what makes
  a test for a *deleted* feature detectable: it is reachable from the test
  runner but its subject import is broken or gone -- flag those as
  candidates in the evidence phase, not here.
- **Ties go to KEEP.** The failure mode of a too-large keep-set is a few
  dead files surviving; the failure mode of a too-small one is a broken
  application. These are not symmetric.
